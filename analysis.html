                    <span class="style8">The earlier business analysis and requirements work flows focused on   establishing <strong>what</strong> is needed while Shreeji Computers work stream, the   system analysis and design, focuses on determining <strong>how</strong> they are   best implemented. To support the decision making activity technical options are   developed, that is alternative functional and physical designs are simulated for   performance, utilisation levels against user demands, and even deriving a   dynamic cash flow and P&amp;L model, and tested with users during scenario work   shops. Studying the results allows judgements to be made where functionality,   performance, cost, delivery time and risk can be compared and traded off, and an   appropriate set of requirements and design specification can be achieved. </span></p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Models test the solution early on, and act as the basis for refining   requirements and the design, and driving trade offs. When a solution model can   be shown to meet the functional and non-functional requirements imposed on it,   the solutions detailed build can commence in confidence or the componants of the   systems models form the basis of new derived requirements which are then flowed   down to the next level, with the process then repeating its self. </p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Shreeji Computers work flow commences with a detailed analysis of the requirements that   have been flowed down and typical activities perfomred by Shreeji Computers include; </p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Refine the user interfaces such as GUI's and report out puts for example. It   is likely initial designs where prepared by the business analysis work stream,   detailing the information that is captured, manipulated, and outputed.</p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Analysing the data requirements, particulary persistence data, and develping   normalised relational data tables, with mapping to appropriate user, business   and data objects. Similarly mapping business rules captured from the business   analysis and requirements work streams, stored in a central respository to   business objects or objects properties and methods. </p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Look for commonality in service requirements and rules that must be   implemented, identifying objects whether they are physical asets or software   componants, and understanding the messaging that must pass between them, so   building up an object model and constructing object sequence diagrams. On to the   latter Shreeji Computers can allocate apportioned timing requirements for example which   then provide targets that other designers and solution builders need to achieve   as the build progresses, meaning that if they achieve them individually it is   likely the overall end to end times are allow maintained. </p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Functional allocation or object allocation to the physical architecture or   infrastructure. Shreeji Computers requires establishing what is available from existing   products and software componants, where technology insertion is feasable, where   new technologys or products can be used to provide additional leverage on   business benefits, and determining buildability, instalatability, supportability   and whole life management issues. </p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Combining the object model, particularly in terms of message passing between   objects and the physical architecture model, to test that the overall end to end   non-functional requirements can be met. Shreeji Computers looks at the total number of   instances of each object that may be required at any one time and how they are   are distributed over the client, business, and data architecture. Such models   can be simulated to ensure that processor, memory, and communication channels   are sufficient to cope with the users non-functional requirements. </p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Analysis of the physical architecture and object design for safety,   security, and maintenance implications,and to build a whole life cost model,   again ensuring the user requirements are fulfilled, and that exception   conditions are identified and management arrangements specified and implemented</p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">An area that Shreeji Computers specialise in as part of the systems analysis   work stream is performance engineering. A typical problem encountered with UML   analysis and design is that people treat the use case, the robustness model,   object and sequence models as static representations. Remember in reality a   number of use case scenarios will be activie at any one time, and common objects   may be delivering services a number of use cases at any one time, and that a   number of objects may be applied to the same physcical architecture which will   all compete for resources at the same it. They do not take in to account the   fact that many loading and response testing packages actually require the   physical architecture to be present - what the applications do is simulate the   boundary work load and monitoring the end o end performance and monitor the   systems capacity to hanlde that work load. Our contribution is early on in the   work stream, joining together the information and start to test early on whether   a design solution will <strong>really</strong> meet the performance requirements   before building the physical architecture. Such early testing might conclude   that certain object strucutre, messaging strucutre, or architecture allocations   are more benefical than others or offer better scaleability or expandability.</p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Shreeji Computers also offer verfication and validation support services to both   structured methods such as Yourdon, Yourdon Ward-Mellor, and SSADM, as well as   OOAD methods such as UML. Typical tracing tasks for UML include mapping use case   preconditions, steps and post conditions to an objects properties and methods to   ensure completeness and collating evidence that overall object loading can be   implemented by the chosen physical architecture. </p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Shreeji Computerss approach to systems analysis and design applys equally to call   centres and business work flow systems through to manufacturing and transport   management solutions. In iterative development analysis, prototyping and early   product deployment helps to derive and flush out detailed requirements, which   are passed back into the specification and test plans. The requirements are then   flowed into the design whether its <strong>commercially off the shelf</strong> or a <strong>custom development</strong>, or a mixture taking account of what's   available. Shreeji Computers builds up a functional architecture and maps to a physical   architecture of equipment and applications, and the organisational structure. </p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">The critical factor here is the tight relationship between the requirements   and the actual solution which can then be traced ultimately through to the   business model, drivers, and benefits. The effect of changes anywhere along the   chain can be established. Traditionally the process was either to use a method   where detailed requirements were established, followed by analysis, and build   phases occuring sequentially only to find late in the day it does not   technically work or it has lost track of the business need, or alternative   approach has been used, where the process was to immediately start to build or   code without an adequate understanding of the business needs and ending up with   a great solution but for the wrong problem. </p>

                    <p align="justify" class="style8">Using the approach we recommend provides early confidence, addresses the   business needs, and provides a means by which the needed services will be   realised can be seen and evaluated, with real progress is being made with real   products. It combines the best of both methods. click <a href="Software_Development.html">here</a> to return to our solutions development   main page. </p></td>
